## Description

This is an applicaion that was built to practice making API calls.
A user will be able to find a list of doctors based off of a condition (conditions retrieved from an API call), or they can search the BetterDoctor database for a doctor based off of their name.

## Installation instructions

To use this app, first clone the repositiory from [GitHub](https://github.com/68thandMaine/Galatic-Age-Calculator.git). Once the app has been appropriately cloned the app can be accessed by using the following commands in the terminal:
1. `$npm install`
  - This command will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
2. `$npm run build`
  - This command will instruct webpack to bundle all code into a folder named dist.

After running these two commands find the file named `index.html` in the newly created dist folder and drag it to Chrome.

## Application Specs

Testing for this project was not required as per Epicouds project guidelines.

## Known or Potential Errors

At this time the UI is not as intuitive as I would like. I will eventually find the time to enahnce the UI experience. I also need to continue to build the look of the divs and handle lagging animations.
